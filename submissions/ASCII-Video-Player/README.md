## Prerequisites
Must have python installed (with pip) to be able to run the python code. Python can be installed on the official python website(https://www.python.org/). Afterwards, install these modules by running this on the command line:

`pip install numpy opencv-python pygame-ce moviepy`

or

`pip3 install numpy opencv-python pygame-ce moviepy`

## How to use
First, navigate to the directory where the python code (ASCII Video Player.py) is located. Make sure that the WAV file (temp_audio.wav) is in the same directory as the python code. Next, open up terminal and enter in the following command:

`python ".\ASCII Video Player.py" "PATH TO VIDEO FILE"`

It is recommended by me that the video should be 200 pixels wide and 150 pixels tall for smooth video playing.
